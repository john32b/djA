 - TiledMap Editor parser (_.xml format_)
 - Generic config file parser/writer
 - String tools
 

## Install:

To install a specific version, [get the zip file first](https://github.com/john32b/djA/tags/)  
`haxelib install djA-0.1.zip`


## What, Why

Code that I was using from other programs that were written for different targets, like nodejs and hashlink. This is just a small personal lib. There is no documentation other than the comments on the source files.
